# LucidCamera_cpp
This program demonstrates the acquisition, processing, and visualization of 3D camera data using the Arena SDK, OpenCV, and PCL. It captures 3D point cloud data and intensity information from a camera, generates a point cloud and a grayscale image, and displays both in real-time with the frame rate (FPS) overlaid on the grayscale image.
